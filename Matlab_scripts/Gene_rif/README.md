This MATLAB script performs a multi-step analysis to integrate gene function annotations, immune relevance, and expression data. It retrieves GeneRIF annotations from NCBI for a list of gene IDs, filters genes based on immune-related keywords, assesses their expression levels across immune cell types, and compares gene sets to identify unique or underexpressed candidates. The overall goal is to prioritize genes with functional, immunological, and expression-based evidence for further analysis or experimental validation.
